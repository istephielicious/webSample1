                <h2>How to find a reputable electrician</h2>
                <h5>by: Christina Hansen</h5>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <h4>Here are a few tips for finding an electrical contractor who is both licensed and reputable:</h4>
                <h4>Do…</h4>
                <p>Run a quick check with the Better Business Bureau – their reports not only rate businesses with an overall report card-type "grade," but also detail any complaints that may have been filed on a particular business/individual within the past 36 months, as well as any resolutions made in response to those complaints. And if you're really lucky, the BBB report will even recommend which government offices to consult when you're confirming licensing and certification.</p>
                <p>Talk to your friends and neighbors. Have a friend who is (or works for) a general contractor? Ask them who they bring in to tackle the electrical aspects of their own projects. Reputable general contractors won't put their good names on the line to save a few bucks, so their go-to guys are typically a safe bet.</p>
				<p>Insist on seeing proof of your electrical contractor's license, as well as proof of insurance. In the event that an accident or injury occurs while they are working on your property, an uninsured contractor could turn around and sue you, even if you aren't directly involved.</p>

                <h4>Don't...</h4>
                <p>Offer or be talked into pulling permits for a job yourself. An electrician's unwillingness to obtain permits for a project is a major red flag – most often, it signals that the contractor isn't licensed. But even if it turns out that the electrician in question is licensed, the permit issue is an almost sure sign that they'll be difficult to work with.</p>
                <p>Assume that just because a contractor advertises in the Yellow Pages, Pennysaver, or other local publications that they're automatically a safe and reputable person to deal with. If you see an electrician's ad that looks appealing, ask around to learn if anyone in your family, neighborhood, or circle of friends has heard anything about or done business with them.</p>
                <p>Unquestioningly trust in the old "don't judge a book by its cover" adage. Regardless of whether or not they can provide proof of license, if an electrical contractor arrives at your home or place of business and behaves unprofessionally, appears to be disorganized or indifferent, or has excessively poor grooming habits, keep in mind that any of these characteristics can foreshadow inferior work down the road. Bottom line: go with your gut instinct. If it doesn't feel right, don't hire them.</p>

        	<h2>Consumer Unit Change / Fuse Box Change</h2>
            <h5>by: Unknown</h5>
            <div class="line"></div>
        	<h4>In A Consumer Unit..</h4>
                <p>Switch off the mains power, then check each fuse to see which one has blown. If your unit has cartridge-type fuses, you will need to buy a new one from an electrical store. If it has rewirable fuses, remove the old fuse wire, making a note of how it is positioned. Replace with a new wire of the correct amperage, winding it round the screws at both ends.</p>
            <h4>In A Fused Connection Unit..</h4>
                <p>Ensure that the unit is switched off, then, using the tip of a slot‑head screwdriver, gently open the fuse holder: this is found next to the switch – on ovens etc this is usually on the wall to the side of the appliance. Replace the old fuse with a ceramic fuse of the same amperage.</p>
            <h5>WARNING</h5>
            	<p>If the fuse blows again immediately, it is likely there is a problem. Consult an electrician.</p>
